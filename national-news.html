            <p>
                PM Modi’s visit comes at a time when HAL has found itself in the spotlight after Indian Air Force
                announced plans to buy more fighter jets, light combat helicopters (LCH), and to upgrade its Sukhoi-30s
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in Bengaluru on Saturday
                and is expected to review the functioning of the state-run plane maker and visit some of its
                manufacturing facilities, officials aware of the matter said on the eve of the high-profile visit.
                <br><br>The PM is likely to visit the production facility for the light combat aircraft (LCA) too, said
                the officials, asking not to be named. <br><br>Modi’s visit comes at a time when HAL has found itself in
                the spotlight after the Indian Air Force announced plans to buy more fighter jets, and light combat
                helicopters (LCH) and to upgrade its Sukhoi-30s. These potential contracts are worth billions of
                dollars.
                <br><br>
                HAL is also set to begin work on jointly designing and developing helicopter engines with French firm
                Safran and is negotiating a deal for the joint production of fighter jet engines in the country with US
                firm GE Aerospace.
                <br><br>
                HAL is preparing to activate new production lines in Nashik for the LCA Mk-1A and Hindustan Turbo
                Trainer-40 (HTT-40) planes to meet IAF’s growing requirements for fighter jets and basic trainers, as
                previously reported by HT.

            <h2>Drilling at Uttarkashi tunnel halted again, auger machine brought out</h2>

                Uttarakhand tunnel rescue work stopped on Friday night once again owing to a technical glitch.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">

                The rescuers in Uttarakhand's Silkaya tunnel again encountered a roadblock and the drilling had to be
                stopped on Friday evening owing to some technical glitch. The auger machine was brought out to examine
                the latest technical snag as the experts assured that the drilling work would soon begin. The countdown
                was dragging on as the wait for the 41 construction workers has only been getting longer since Thursday.
                On Friday too, the workers could not be extracted even though the operation was at the very last stage.
                Since Thursday night, the rescuers have been busy fixing the auger machine as it hit a metallic object.
                It was fixed on Friday but there was another technical glitch. <br><br>The auger machine is drilling
                through debris to insert pipes through which the trapped men will be rescued. Inside the debris, there
                are metal obstacles stopping the machine. The rescuers, on Thursday night, used gas cutters to remove a
                similar roadblock. Another obstacle came when it was found that one of the pipes got bent. The auger
                machine was brought out. Owing to all this pressure, the platform in which the auger machine was set
                developed a crack. Quick dry cement was used to mend the platform.

            <h2>In no other state, police officers involved in NDPS cases: SC tells Punjab govt</h2>

                Raj Jit Singh Hundal – to file a response to the Punjab government’s allegation that he was not
                cooperating with the probe.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                The Supreme Court on Friday observed that Punjab is the only state where it has come across the
                involvement of police officers in drug-related offences while considering a petition filed by a sacked
                senior police officer seeking anticipatory bail in a case under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic
                Substances (NDPS) Act. <br><br>
                There is no other state where police officers are involved in NDPS cases. In no other state do we find
                this,” said a bench of justices BR Gavai and PK Mishra as the bench posted the matter for November 28 to
                enable the officer– dismissed additional inspector general (AIG) Raj Jit Singh Hundal – to file a
                response to the Punjab government’s allegation that he was not cooperating with the probe. <br><br>
                While the Court had on October 6 granted anticipatory bail to Hundal in one of the three cases
                registered against him, the Punjab government filed an affidavit claiming that two other cases, one
                under the NDPS and another for disproportionate assets under the Prevention of Corruption Act, are also
                pending against the dismissed officer.

                Indian Army dog named ‘Domino’ and his handler Lance Naik Lucky Kumar on Friday were awarded for their
                role in tracking down a Pakistani terrorist in the recent Rajouri encounter in which five soldiers were
                martyred. According to the Indian Army officials, the dog helped the troops reach the hideout of
                terrorists by sniffing their blood trail in the Kalakote area, even after he had been injured in a
                gunfight.

                Over the past 15 years, India has developed a certain amount of counterterrorism response.

            <p class="hidden">
                Ahead of the 15th year anniversary of 26/11 terror attacks in India's financial capital Mumbai, launched
                by Pakistan-based terrorists, there are concerns about whether a similar attack could be carried again.
                The concerns come in the backdrop of Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7, which claimed the lives of
                at least 1,400 Israeli civilians. <br><br>
                26/11 can definitely happen in India after what has happened in Israel on October 7. The terrorist
                groups which have state support like Iran in the case of Hamas-Israel war or Pakistan in 26/11 terror
                attacks, can wreak havoc, create mhem and do a bloody campaign against the innocent civilians all over
                the world.

                    On Wednesday night, a senior official expressed his confidence that rescuers would reach workers and
                    complete the operation today.
                    <br>
                    The team found steel rods embedded in the debris which caused some hindrance in the drilling

                    check-ups of the workers, it said.

                        Israeli hostages released later, Qatar said on Thursday.
                        <br>
                        What are the details of the deal?
                        Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari while addressing the reporters in Doha,
                        informed that the truce deal would include a comprehensive ceasefire in both the north and south
                        of
                        the Gaza Strip.

                        The first ceasefire in the war triggered by the Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7,
                        would
                        be accompanied by the release of 50 women and children hostages captured by the Hamas
                        terrorists,
                        while around 150 Palestinian detainees would also be released from Israeli jails as part of the
                        deal.
                        <br>
                        The first group of hostages to be released on Friday would be 13 women and children, Ansari
                        further
                        informed. "If there were a group of hostages from the same family they will be released together
                        in
                        this first batch," he added.<br>
                        "During these four days, information will be collected about the rest of the hostages to
                        consider
                        the possibility of more releases and thus extending the pause," Ansari added.
                        <br>
                        However, Israel has said that the peace deal could go beyond four days if Hamas would set free
                        at
                        least 10 hostages per day. The Qatar spokesperson also said that it hoped to negotiate a
                        subsequent
                        agreement to release additional hostages from Gaza by the fourth day of the truce. Israeli PM
                        Benjamin Netanyahu also made it clear that the country was not ending its war on Gaza and that
                        the
                        stopping of fighting was only temporary.
                        <br>
                        Commenting on the pause, Ansari said that it entailed "a complete ceasefire... with no attacks
                        from
                        the air or the ground," adding that he hoped "there will be no violations".
