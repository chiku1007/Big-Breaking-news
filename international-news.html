            <h2>Why do Americans prefer Harry, Meghan, William, and Kate to King and Queen?</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/24/550x309/Britain-Coronation-Family-Drama-0_1685798398971_1700838498017.jpg"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                Harry and Meghan, William and Kate are preferred faces of the monarchy in the US due to their
                relatability and modernity.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Americans have a royal fascination, and it's not just the tea and crumpets kind. According to royal
                author Clive Irving, the popularity of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince William, and Kate Middleton
                in the U.S. can be attributed to their relatability and ability to "live in the current moment."
                <br><br>
                Irving notes that the American audience prefers the modernity embodied by Harry and Meghan, as well as
                William and Kate, over the prospect of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. "Americans would love to see
                the monarchy much more like Harry and Meghan than like King Charles and Queen Camilla," Irving remarked.
                <br><br>Since Harry and Meghan's relocation to California, the focus has shifted to William and Kate,
                who share a similar appeal. Both couples are perceived as living in the present moment, a stark contrast
                to other members of the royal family who, as Irving puts it, "seem to have lost the plot."
                <br><br>
                Irving emphasizes William's understanding of the American mood and reality, suggesting that he resonates
                more with the U.S. audience than his father, King Charles. This sentiment is reinforced by William's
                rumored plans for a modern coronation, skipping certain traditional elements that drew criticism during
                King Charles's ceremony.

                British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the governing Conservatives are enjoying a small bump in the
                opinion polls after some crowd-pleasing tax cuts were announced in the Autumn Statement budget this
                week, it emerged on November 24.
                <br><br>
                According to a YouGov survey for ‘The Times’ conducted after the budget was tabled by UK Chancellor
                Jeremy Hunt in Parliament on Wednesday, the popularity rating for the Sunak-led Tories rose to 25% —
                which is four points up from the previous week, the party’s highest rating in recent weeks.

                Is boycotting Black Friday an effective protest against the Israeli-Hamas war?
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Some social media users are urging the community to boycott Black Friday, the annual discount day on
                November 24, as a form of protest against the ongoing Israeli-Hamas war. <br><br>They argue that the
                deal reached between Israeli officials and Hamas, which involves a temporary 5 days halt in fighting,
                the release of at least 50 hostages by Hamas, more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and 150 Palestinian women
                and teenagers freed from Israeli jails, is not enough to end the conflict. <br><br>They insisted on an
                immediate cessation of the conflict and urged participation in the Black Friday boycott in support of
                the Palestinian community. They claim that the pause in fighting is only meant to allow shoppers to
                “spend guilt free” and suggest that consumers should “hit them in their pockets” by not participating in
                the discount day.
                <br><br>
                Some posts supporting the boycott have reached tens of thousands of people on platforms such as X
                (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

                China has been taking steps in recent months - including restoring international flight routes - to
                revive its tourism sector.

            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                China will temporarily exempt citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia
                from needing visas to visit the world's second-largest economy in a bid to give a boost to post-pandemic
                tourism. <br><br>
                From Dec. 1 to Nov. 30 next year, citizens of those countries entering China for business, tourism, visiting relatives and friends, or transiting for no more than 15 days, will not need a visa, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday. <br><br>China has been taking steps in recent months - including restoring international flight routes - to revive its tourism sector following three years of strict COVID-19 measures that largely shut its borders to the outside world.
<br><br>
                The government is also looking to re-establish its image around the world after clashing with many Western countries on various issues including COVID, human rights, Taiwan and trade.
                <br><br>
                A recent Pew Research Center survey in 24 countries revealed that views of China were broadly negative, with 67% of adults expressing unfavourable views.

                <p>
                    The decision comes in the wake of accusations that TMC MP Mahua Moitra asked Parliamentary questions
                    in exchange for monetary benefits, with concerns raised about who had access to her log-in
                    credentials

                <p class="hidden">
                    Ahead of the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, access to the questions portal has been
                    restricted to Lok Sabha MPs only, excluding their personal staff, according to sources. No official
                    orders have been issued. The process of filing questions for Rajya Sabha MPs continues as before,
                    with personal assistants also having access.
                    <br><br>
                    The Parliament website for both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha was upgraded on August <br><br>
                    Instead of two different portals — one for ‘e-notices’, to submit questions, notices and private
                    bills, and a separate members’ portal to submit travel bills and other necessities — a single,
                    common portal was launched. Sources said that, till recently, Lok Sabha MPs and their designated
                    personal assistants each had log-in credentials for this portal. Ahead of the winter session, this
                    has been restricted to just the MPs’ registered numbers.
