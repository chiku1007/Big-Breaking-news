            <h2>Mumbai Indians plotting shock comeback for Hardik Pandya. Here's what GT is likely to get</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/24/550x309/EysFFpLW8AA3b6a_1654268042045_1700857458831.jpg"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                It's likely to be a cash-only deal as MI are set to pay ₹15 crore to GT to get back star India
                all-rounder Hardik Pandya in their side before IPL 2024.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                All-rounder Hardik Pandya is in talks with five-time Indian Premier League (IPL) champions Mumbai
                Indians for a shock return in what could be the most talked about trade in the league's history.
                Pandya's IPL career started with MI back in 2015 and now multiple reports confirm MI are in talks with
                Pandya for him to return to the fold as they see a long-term captain in him. <br><br> It's likely to be
                a cash-only trade with MI ready to shell out ₹15 crore for the star all-rounder. Confirmation of whether
                the deal goes through or not may come only in the final hours of the trading day deadline on Sunday.
                <br><br>It’s as of yet unclear if that would mean Pandya playing the next IPL under Rohit Sharma for a
                year. Pandya has been leading the Indian team in T20Is for much of 2023 with Rohit having last played a
                game in the format only in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup last year. <br><br>Besides, for the trade
                to materialize, MI will have to release more than one big player to have enough funds available – they
                are sitting with merely ₹5,00,000 currently. Pandya’s worth is ₹15 crore and that may force the Mumbai
                franchise to release a player like Ishan Kishan ( ₹15.25) or even Jofra Archer ( ₹8 crore) if his return
                to fitness looks bleak. There has also been a suggestion that Gujarat want Cameron Green and another
                player.

            <h2>Shami attacks Marsh for putting feet on World Cup trophy. ‘Hurt me a lot. Everyone wants to lift it over
                their head...’</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/24/550x309/MixCollage-24-Nov-2023-11-48-PM-1858_1700849969849_1700849979955.jpg"

            <p>
                Mohammed Shami wasn't too pleased with Mitchell Marsh's celebration after Australia's win in the 2023
                World Cup.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Australia produced a strong performance in the final of the 2023 World Cup, beating India by six wickets
                to clinch a sixth title. The Pat Cummins-led Aussie side defied the odds to beat the high-flying home
                side that was on a ten-match unbeaten run in the competition. After opting to bowl on a sluggish surface
                in Ahmedabad, Australia bowled Rohit Sharma's men out on 240 before chasing down the target with seven
                overs remaining, as conditions grew conducive towards batting under the lights. <br><br>However,
                following the match, a picture from Australia's celebrations went viral on social media platforms, with
                Indian fans heavily criticising Mitchell Marsh, one of the members of the Aussie winning squad. In the
                picture, Marsh can be seen resting his foot on the top of the World Cup trophy, and many Indian fans
                criticised the Australian all-rounder for showing a lack of respect. <br><br>Earlier this week, Mohammed
                Shami, India's star bowler who ended as the 2023 edition's highest wicket-taker (24 dismissals in 7
                matches), spoke about the picture as he arrived in Amroha to visit his village. Shami spoke strongly
                against Marsh's celebration, stating that he was “hurt” with the celebration.
                <br><br>
                “This hurt me a lot as well. All countries fight for this trophy, everyone wants to lift the trophy over
                their head. And I didn't like that he rested his foot on that trophy. He should not be doing that,” said
                Shami during an interaction with media persons.

            <p>
                PV Sindhu has been struggling to find her best form and will hope the Indian legend can change that.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                In 2014, Saina Nehwal stunned the badminton world by making a bold move of shifting base from Hyderabad
                to Bengaluru. The Olympic medallist ‘split’ with childhood coach Pullela Gopichand and moved to the
                Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) to train under U Vimal Kumar. <br><br>Criticised initially,
                the move yielded results which defined the 33-year-old's career. Under Vimal, Saina became a world No.1
                — the only Indian female yet, reached the All England Open final and won two World Championship medals
                (silver and bronze). <br><br>Exactly nine years later, compatriot PV Sindhu has made a similar move. She
                will now train under the great Padukone in the hope of resurrecting her career even as she aims for an
                unprecedented third consecutive Olympic medal.
                <br><br>
                Sindhu enjoyed a successful 2022 when she won an Asian Championships bronze, the Swiss Open and
                Singapore Open titles before claiming the Commonwealth Games gold when she suffered a stress fracture in
                her left foot that put her out of action for six months.

            <h2> Before Paris, a trial awaits India's shooters..</h2>

                Four domestic trials will decide the names of the Olympians but leaving it too late will mean
                preparation will be impacted
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                India's shooters are about to enter an unknown territory in the run-up to the Paris Olympics next year.
                A set of four domestic trials will confirm their places for the Olympics. That puts them in a tricky
                situation as the shooters will have to first prioritise getting selected for the team before they can
                think of stepping up for the Paris Olympics. <br><br>This is the first time that the national shooting
                federation (NRAI), having burnt their fingers in the previous two Olympics, has put the onus of
                selection completely on domestic trials that will judge a shooter on current form. It is a far cry from
                their previous Olympic selection policies of round-the-year assessment. <br><br>Indian shooters have so
                far won 13 quota places -- all the eight Paris Olympic spots in rifle have been grabbed -- but no one
                knows who will be on the flight to Paris until the selection trials, the dates of which are yet to be
                announced, are finished. The quota place winners will have a small advantage of bonus points, but that
                too has been drastically cut down from last time, throwing the competition for a prized spot in the
                Paris Olympics squad wide open.

                Mbappe's penalty against his former club restored PSG's lead and two superb goals in the space of three
                minutes by Dembele and Vitinha put the game out of sight

            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Ousmane Dembele scored his first Paris Saint-Germain goal in stunning fashion as the reigning French
                champions crushed Monaco 5-2 in Ligue 1 on Friday to cement their lead at the top of the table. <br><br>
                Goncalo Ramos opened the scoring early on for PSG but a howler by home goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma
                gifted Takumi Minamino the equaliser soon after. <br><br>However, Kylian Mbappe's penalty against his
                former club restored PSG's lead and two superb goals in the space of three second-half minutes by
                Dembele and Vitinha put the game out of sight.
                <br><br>
                Folarin Balogun pulled another back for Monaco but substitute Randal Kolo Muani put the seal on PSG's
                win in stoppage time.
                <br><br>
                Paris have now won seven and drawn one of their last eight Ligue 1 games and this result moved them four
                points clear of second-placed Nice, who are in action on Sunday. Monaco remain third but are six points
                adrift of the leaders.

            <p>
                Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan enjoys friendly ties with most of the
                BRICS members, as well as the newly invited group of countries
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Pakistan on Thursday confirmed that it has applied for membership in the BRICS grouping.
                <br>
                <br>

                Pakistan’s application to join the the five-nation bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and
                South Africa came as the grouping of emerging economies was set for its biggest expansion with six new
                members under Moscow's rotating Presidency in 2024.
                <br><br>
                This year’s BRICS summit held in South Africa formally admitted Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi
                Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as new members. They will formally join during the 2024 summit
                in Russia
                <br><br>
                “Yes, I can confirm that Pakistan has made a formal request to join BRICS, which we believe is an
                important grouping of developing countries,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in her

                Daniel Noboa, an inexperienced politician and heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, was sworn in
                on Thursday as Ecuador's President, a role that citizens are demanding he uses to restore the public
                safety that drug cartels and other criminal organizations robbed them of at the decade's start.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mr. Noboa’s term will run only through May 2025, which is what remains of former President Guillermo
                Lasso's tenure. Mr. Lasso cut his term short when he dissolved the National Assembly in May as lawmakers
                pursued impeachment proceedings against him.
                <br><br>
                The head of the country's newly elected legislature, Henry Kronfle, placed the presidential sash on Mr.
                Noboa during a ceremony in Quito, the capital.
                <br><br>
                Under Mr. Lasso’s watch, violent deaths in Ecuador soared, reaching a record 4,600 in 2022, which was
                double the number from the year before. Killings, kidnappings, robberies and other criminal activities
                became part of Ecuadorians’ everyday life.

                the Bangladesh China India Myanmar (BCIM) corridor which has largely stalled.

                <h3>No official orders, but Lok Sabha cuts access to questions portal for staff of MPs </h3>
                <p>
                    The decision comes in the wake of accusations that TMC MP Mahua Moitra asked Parliamentary questions
                    in exchange for monetary benefits, with concerns raised about who had access to her log-in
                    credentials
                </p>
                <p class="hidden">
                    Ahead of the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, access to the questions portal has been
                    restricted to Lok Sabha MPs only, excluding their personal staff, according to sources. No official
                    orders have been issued. The process of filing questions for Rajya Sabha MPs continues as before,
                    with personal assistants also having access.
                    <br><br>
                    The Parliament website for both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha was upgraded on August <br><br>
                    Instead of two different portals — one for ‘e-notices’, to submit questions, notices and private
                    bills, and a separate members’ portal to submit travel bills and other necessities — a single,
                    common portal was launched. Sources said that, till recently, Lok Sabha MPs and their designated
                    personal assistants each had log-in credentials for this portal. Ahead of the winter session, this
                    has been restricted to just the MPs’ registered numbers.
