                Uttarakhand tunnel collapse Live updates: After more than a week's endeavour to reach the 41 workers
                trapped in a collapsed tunnel in Uttarakhand, the rescue and relief operation has entered its last
                stage
                after rescuers managed to place broad pipes up to a depth of 45 metres through the debris via
                horizontal
                drilling. Further drilling is underway.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">


                Digging to rescue 41 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel is in the final stretch(ANI)
                On Wednesday night, a senior official expressed his confidence that rescuers would reach workers and
                complete the operation today.
                <br>
                The team found steel rods embedded in the debris which caused some hindrance in the drilling
                process,
                however, the officials said they managed to remove all the pieces of steel and carry out the final
                process to insert the last bit of pipeline through the rubble.
                <br>
                Earlier on Wednesday, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel entered the tunnel, an
                official statement issued by Uttarakhand Chief Minister's Office said.
                <br>
                An ambulance is also deployed inside the tunnel and a team of doctors is also put on stand-by for
                health
                check-ups of the workers, it said.
                <br>
                Meanwhile, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will undertake a safety audit of all 29
                under-construction tunnels across the country to ensure safety and adherence to the highest quality
                standards, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said on Wednesday.

            <h2>Himalayan geology not predictable: Experts on Uttarkashi tunnel rescue timeline</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/24/550x309/PTI11-24-2023-000125B-0_1700826405183_1700826445057.jpg"

            <p>
                Himalayan geology is not a precise science and many roadblocks have come in the way of the multi-agency,
                12-day rescue operation, so far.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                The Himalayan geology is not as predictable as people think, experts said on Friday as the Uttarkashi
                tunnel rescue operation went on overcoming new hurdles at the last moment. Addressing a press meet over
                the ongoing progress of the rescue work, National Highways Authority of India member (admin) Vishal
                Chauhan said Himalayan geology is unpredictable and several roadblocks came in the way, despite the best
                efforts of all the government and private agencies. <br><br>
                "The maximum tunnelling is going on in Jammu and Kashmir and then in Arunachal Pradesh. The Atal tunnel
                is an example of great tunnelling work in Himachal. We are continuously learning our lessons...what
                happened in Uttarkashi is an unfortunate thing. Himalayan geology is still not a precise science but
                it's improving by the day It's not that we are having an accident every year or once in two years.
                <br><br>I
                haven't heard of an accident like this in years. I have travelled all the tunnels of Jammu and Kashmir.
                Excellent technology is being used," NDMA member Lt General Syed Ata Hasnain (Retd) said commenting on
                the delay in the rescue work -- as the 41 men trapped in the Silkyara tunnel were expected to be rescued
                on Thursday night but the operation hit a snag.

            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                The Reserve Bank on Friday imposed penalties totalling ₹10.34 crore on Citibank, Bank of Baroda, and
                Indian Overseas Bank for contravention of various regulatory norms. <br><br>The highest penalty of ₹5
                crore has been imposed on Citibank NA for non-compliance of norms related to depositor education and
                awareness fund scheme, and code of conduct on outsourcing of financial services, the RBI said in a
                statement. <br><br>A fine of ₹4.34 core was imposed on the state-owned Bank of Baroda for violation of
                certain directions related to the creation of a central repository of large common exposures, and
                others, another release said.

                Rinku Singh's consistency at the end of an innings has drawn comparison with what MS Dhoni used to do
                regularly at his peak.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Rinku Singh showed yet again why he is the perfect candidate to be India's finisher in the T20 World Cup
                next year when he pushed India over the line in a record chase against Australia. India chased down a
                target of 209, their highest successful chase in a T20I against Australia, to take a 1-0 lead in the
                five-match series. While stand-in captain Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan's half-centuries powered
                much of the chase, there was still a lot to do when the pair fell and it Rinku's unbeaten 22 off 14 that
                took India over the line. <br><br>Rinku's consistency at the end of an innings has been commented on
                since he did it time and again for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL earlier this year. He has often been
                compared to the kind of impact the great MS Dhoni used to have as a finished. Rinku admitted that a
                conversation with the former India captain has helped him perform. “I had spoken to Mahi bhai once. I
                was asking him what he does in the last over of a match. He was saying that you have to stay as calm as
                possible, and try to hit straight. That is what I try to follow, to remain quiet and not react to
                anything. That has helped me a lot,” he said on BCCI.tv.

                Pope Francis in hot water after his take on Israel and Hamas creates tension with Jewish groups.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Pope Francis has sparked criticism from Jewish groups who think he equated Hamas and Israel with
                “terrorism” in his comments on the Israeli-Palestinian war. <br><br>The pope met with Jewish families
                whose relatives were kidnapped by Hamas, and Palestinians whose families were still in Gaza. He said to
                a crowd in St. Peter’s Square that he saw the suffering of both sides, saying, “This is what wars do.
                But here we have gone beyond wars. This is not war. This is terrorism.” <br><br>However, the Vatican
                denied that the pope used the word “genocide” to describe the situation, as some Palestinians who met
                with him claimed.
                <br><br>
                Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said, “I am not aware that he used such a word.”
                <br><br>
                On Monday 20 November, U.S. officials rejected the accusations of mass genocide by Israel.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Israel is not trying to wipe the Palestinian people off the map. Israel is not trying to wipe Gaza off
                the map. Israel is trying to defend itself against a genocidal terrorist threat,” said White House
                National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.

            <h3>Daniel Noboa sworn in as Ecuador's President, inheriting the leadership of a country on edge</h3>
            <p>
                An inexperienced politician and heir to a fortune built on the banana trade has been sworn in as
                Ecuador's president
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Daniel Noboa, an inexperienced politician and heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, was sworn in
                on Thursday as Ecuador's President, a role that citizens are demanding he uses to restore the public
                safety that drug cartels and other criminal organizations robbed them of at the decade's start.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mr. Noboa’s term will run only through May 2025, which is what remains of former President Guillermo
                Lasso's tenure. Mr. Lasso cut his term short when he dissolved the National Assembly in May as lawmakers
                pursued impeachment proceedings against him.
                <br><br>
                The head of the country's newly elected legislature, Henry Kronfle, placed the presidential sash on Mr.
                Noboa during a ceremony in Quito, the capital.
                <br><br>
                Under Mr. Lasso’s watch, violent deaths in Ecuador soared, reaching a record 4,600 in 2022, which was
                double the number from the year before. Killings, kidnappings, robberies and other criminal activities
                became part of Ecuadorians’ everyday life.

            <p>
                During this period, Gaza's ruling Hamas group pledged to free at least 50 of the about 240 hostages it
                and other militants took on October 7

            <p class="hidden">

                A four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war took effect early on November 24, setting the stage for the
                exchange of dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza in return for Palestinians imprisoned by
                Israel.
                <br><br>
                The halt in fighting promised some relief for Gaza's 2.3 million people, who have endured weeks of
                Israeli bombardment, as well as families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken
                captive during Hamas' October 7 attack that triggered the war. <br><br>
