                    Uttarakhand tunnel collapse Live updates: After more than a week's endeavour to reach the 41 workers
                    trapped in a collapsed tunnel in Uttarakhand, the rescue and relief operation has entered its last
                    stage
                    after rescuers managed to place broad pipes up to a depth of 45 metres through the debris via
                    horizontal
                    drilling. Further drilling is underway.

                    Digging to rescue 41 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel is in the final stretch(ANI)
                    On Wednesday night, a senior official expressed his confidence that rescuers would reach workers and
                    complete the operation today.
                    <br>
                    The team found steel rods embedded in the debris which caused some hindrance in the drilling
                    process,
                    however, the officials said they managed to remove all the pieces of steel and carry out the final
                    process to insert the last bit of pipeline through the rubble.
                    <br>
                    Earlier on Wednesday, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel entered the tunnel, an
                    official statement issued by Uttarakhand Chief Minister's Office said.
                    <br>
                    An ambulance is also deployed inside the tunnel and a team of doctors is also put on stand-by for
                    health
                    check-ups of the workers, it said.
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will undertake a safety audit of all 29
                    under-construction tunnels across the country to ensure safety and adherence to the highest quality
                    standards, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said on Wednesday.

                        Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson informed that the truce deal would include a comprehensive
                        ceasefire in both the north and south of the Gaza Strip.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        After seven weeks of bombardments resulting in loss of lives and property, Israel and
                        Palestinian
                        militant group Hamas have agreed to a four-day truce beginning Friday with the first batch of
                        Israeli hostages released later, Qatar said on Thursday.
                        <br>
                        What are the details of the deal?
                        Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari while addressing the reporters in Doha,
                        informed that the truce deal would include a comprehensive ceasefire in both the north and south
                        of
                        the Gaza Strip.

                        The first ceasefire in the war triggered by the Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7,
                        would
                        be accompanied by the release of 50 women and children hostages captured by the Hamas
                        terrorists,
                        while around 150 Palestinian detainees would also be released from Israeli jails as part of the
                        deal.
                        <br>
                        The first group of hostages to be released on Friday would be 13 women and children, Ansari
                        further
                        informed. "If there were a group of hostages from the same family they will be released together
                        in
                        this first batch," he added.<br>
                        "During these four days, information will be collected about the rest of the hostages to
                        consider
                        the possibility of more releases and thus extending the pause," Ansari added.
                        <br>
                        However, Israel has said that the peace deal could go beyond four days if Hamas would set free
                        at
                        least 10 hostages per day. The Qatar spokesperson also said that it hoped to negotiate a
                        subsequent
                        agreement to release additional hostages from Gaza by the fourth day of the truce. Israeli PM
                        Benjamin Netanyahu also made it clear that the country was not ending its war on Gaza and that
                        the
                        stopping of fighting was only temporary.
                        <br>
                        Commenting on the pause, Ansari said that it entailed "a complete ceasefire... with no attacks
                        from
                        the air or the ground," adding that he hoped "there will be no violations".

            <h3>Pakistan confirms it has applied for BRICS membership</h3>
            <p>
                Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said Pakistan enjoys friendly ties with most of the
                BRICS members, as well as the newly invited group of countries
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Pakistan on Thursday confirmed that it has applied for membership in the BRICS grouping.
                <br>
                <br>

                Pakistan’s application to join the the five-nation bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and
                South Africa came as the grouping of emerging economies was set for its biggest expansion with six new
                members under Moscow's rotating Presidency in 2024.
                <br><br>
                This year’s BRICS summit held in South Africa formally admitted Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi
                Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as new members. They will formally join during the 2024 summit
                in Russia
                <br><br>
                “Yes, I can confirm that Pakistan has made a formal request to join BRICS, which we believe is an
                important grouping of developing countries,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in her
                weekly press briefing.

                Daniel Noboa, an inexperienced politician and heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, was sworn in
                on Thursday as Ecuador's President, a role that citizens are demanding he uses to restore the public
                safety that drug cartels and other criminal organizations robbed them of at the decade's start.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mr. Noboa’s term will run only through May 2025, which is what remains of former President Guillermo
                Lasso's tenure. Mr. Lasso cut his term short when he dissolved the National Assembly in May as lawmakers
                pursued impeachment proceedings against him.
                <br><br>
                The head of the country's newly elected legislature, Henry Kronfle, placed the presidential sash on Mr.
                Noboa during a ceremony in Quito, the capital.
                <br><br>
                Under Mr. Lasso’s watch, violent deaths in Ecuador soared, reaching a record 4,600 in 2022, which was
                double the number from the year before. Killings, kidnappings, robberies and other criminal activities
                became part of Ecuadorians’ everyday life.

            <p>
                During this period, Gaza's ruling Hamas group pledged to free at least 50 of the about 240 hostages it
                and other militants took on October 7

                A four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war took effect early on November 24, setting the stage for the
                exchange of dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza in return for Palestinians imprisoned by
                Israel.
                <br><br>
                The halt in fighting promised some relief for Gaza's 2.3 million people, who have endured weeks of
                Israeli bombardment, as well as families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken
                captive during Hamas' October 7 attack that triggered the war. <br><br>

                <p>
                    The decision comes in the wake of accusations that TMC MP Mahua Moitra asked Parliamentary questions
                    in exchange for monetary benefits, with concerns raised about who had access to her log-in
                    credentials

                <p class="hidden">
                    Ahead of the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, access to the questions portal has been
                    restricted to Lok Sabha MPs only, excluding their personal staff, according to sources. No official
                    orders have been issued. The process of filing questions for Rajya Sabha MPs continues as before,
                    with personal assistants also having access.
                    <br><br>
                    The Parliament website for both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha was upgraded on August <br><br>
                    Instead of two different portals — one for ‘e-notices’, to submit questions, notices and private
                    bills, and a separate members’ portal to submit travel bills and other necessities — a single,
                    common portal was launched. Sources said that, till recently, Lok Sabha MPs and their designated
                    personal assistants each had log-in credentials for this portal. Ahead of the winter session, this
                    has been restricted to just the MPs’ registered numbers.
