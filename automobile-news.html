            <h2>New Porsche Panamera revealed with more potent hybrid V8, active suspension</h2>
            <img src="https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20231123045445__Porsche%20Panamera%20Web%20Resized%20and%20Watermarked._009.jpeg&w=700&q=90&c=1"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                Porsche isn't holding back on the tech with the Gen 3 Panamera. It gets active suspension and
                strong-hybrid tech on top models.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                It’s been 20 years since the original Panamera was first put on sale. Over the years, Porsche has built
                a healthy 3,85,000 examples of its performance sedan, a number that’s seriously impressive in this age
                of SUVs. <br><br>Even more impressive is that Porsche will go into the future with two distinctive
                performance sedans – this all-new strong-hybrid Panamera third-gen and the all-electric Taycan. And yes,
                demand for the combustion-engined Panamera is still strong, says Porsche.
                <br><br>
                While Porsche calls this a new car, the third-gen isn’t all new. There are, however, significant changes
                made to the chassis, there’s an all-new suspension system, there are new strong-hybrid engines, and you
                get an all-new interior as well as a thoroughly updated exterior. <br><br>But the real big step forward
                with this new one, say Porsche engineers, is that it has managed to deliver both heightened levels of
                dynamic performance as well as higher levels of dynamic comfort, both at the same time. It’s also full
                to the brim with new-age tech, is equipped to pamper luxury car customers and has the performance needed
                to deliver a first-rate driving experience.

            <h2>New Royal Enfield Himalayan launched at Rs 2.69 lakh</h2>
            <img src="https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20231124033822_H4.jpeg&w=700&q=90&c=1"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                Prices go up to Rs 2.84 lakh and are introductory; valid till December 31 2023.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                After what seems like a very long wait, Royal Enfield has finally announced prices for its brand-new
                Himalayan. Prices start at Rs 2.69 lakh for the base Kaza Brown colour while the middle Pass colour
                schemes cost Rs 2.74 lakh. <br><br> The Kamet White colour costs Rs 2.79 lakh and the Hanle Black is the
                most expensive colourway, which is priced at Rs 2.84 lakh. These prices are introductory and are valid
                till December 31, 2023. <br><br>The erstwhile Himalayan 411 was priced between Rs 2.15 lakh – Rs 2.30
                lakh, which makes this new model dearer by roughly Rs 54,000, depending on the colour chosen.
                <br><br>
                The 2024 Himalayan represents a quantum leap forward for the model, with nothing carried forward. A new
                liquid-cooled, 452cc, single-cylinder engine sits at its heart, making 40hp and 40Nm of torque. Dubbed
                the Sherpa 450, it is mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a slip-and-assist clutch. It's a great deal
                lighter and even with its cooling and lubricating fluids, this engine weighs about 10 kg less than the
                old LS 411 motor.

            <h2>Ather confirms two new scooters for launch in 2024</h2>
            <img src="https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20231122063259_20230925051521_20230810053136_Ather%202.jpg&w=700&q=90&c=1"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                One will be aimed at more family-oriented use, while the other will build on existing models’
                performance.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Confirming our previous reports, Ather Energy CEO and co-founder Tarun Mehta has now officially
                confirmed the launch of two new electric scooters in 2024 via a social media post. One will be a new
                family-oriented electric scooter aimed to address a few issues with the existing 450 series that’s
                focused on performance; the other will be an evolution of the existing 450X with improved performance
                and more features. <br><br>New family-oriented Ather scooter: what to expect? <br><br>
                The current 450S and 450X are sporty, fun-to-ride scooters, but their compact size doesn’t quite bode
                well for practicality. And that’s exactly what Ather will be looking to address with the new scooter,
                possibly with a larger and wider seat, a more spacious floorboard and larger boot space to better suit
                the needs of an urban commuter.
                <br><br>
                The scooter may be tuned for greater range and gentler performance in order to better suit its use case.
                It’ll also likely be priced below the existing 450 range in order to make it accessible to a wider
                audience.
                <br><br>
                “It's designed with your entire family in mind, offering comfort, ample size, and a whole lot more – all
                wrapped up in one fantastic package. We're ensuring it's affordable, making the Ather family experience
                accessible to more people,” said Mehta.

            <h2> Tata Nexon CNG – Is it happening?</h2>
            <img src="https://motoroctane.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-26.jpg" alt="Image">
            <p>
                Awo months back in September, Tata Motors launched the Nexon facelift. The SUV comes with options of
                petrol and diesel engines, and even has an EV iteration of the same.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                However, at the time of launch, Tata motors did not talk anything about the CNG version. Also, in a
                recent instance, we came across a video wherein the digital instrument cluster of the Nexon EV displayed
                the CNG metre. Now although it’s a glitch, does that indicate the chances of Nexon CNG? <br><br>Well,
                there is another way to look at it. Firstly, in the current Nexon, we do not have any naturally
                aspirated petrol engine. It is powered by diesel and turbo petrol engines. Also, we have not seen a CNG
                option on turbo petrol engines and putting a CNG on a turbo engine is quite a complicated process.
                <br><br>A turbo engine on a petrol car results in additional air intake boosting the power output. So
                just adding a CNG kit to a turbo engine will never work. The control module of the CNG needs to be
                recalibrated with the turbo engine. That said, Tata Motors is already offering diesel and EV powertrains
                with Nexon who are looking for affordable running costs. And so, there are minimalistic chances of Tata
                Motors adding a CNG to the Nexon turbo petrol.

            <h2>2024 Tata Avinya - The Most Expensive Indian SUV To ever Launch with Land Rover Platform</h2>
            <img src="https://d1qkoatj1w81nl.cloudfront.net/cover/1699877889_876c0ec04d3e4a13_hg.jpg" alt="Image">
            <p>
                First showcased in the Indian Auto Expo of 2022, Tata Avinya will be Tata Motors’ most premium offering
                once it gets launched.

            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                The Avinya is a pure Electric vehicle showcased as a concept in the 2022 Auto Expo. It will host a slew
                of first-hand features, Technology, etc. So, without wasting a single second, let us get into the Tata
                Avinya India Launch Date and Full Details. <br><br>Yes, the main talking point of the town is this: the
                EMA or Electric Mobility Architecture platform, which will be used for JLR’s future high-end EVs and
                will also be used in the Avinya. It will give quite a few advantages to Avinya, as the platform itself
                will be a highly developed unit. Well, how did this happen, you ask?
                <br><br>
                Basically, TPEM, or Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, joined hands with the JLR in order to collaborate
                for the manufacturing of either of their EVs. This agreement mostly focused on JLR’s acceptance of TPEM
                using their EMA platform for the third generation of TPEM vehicles. In fact, JLR will also help TPEM
                build the Avinya initially in order to make things work easy and understandable on Tata’s side.
                <br> <br>
                So, what will this EMA bring? EMA will bring a host of premium features and technology to Tata’s end.
                Some of the most expected ones are Level 2 ADAS, etc. Not only this, but it is highly anticipated that
                the R&D cost for developing Avinya will almost cut by 70%, as JLR will contribute its expertise
                initially.
                <br><br>
                About the manufacturing - First, JLR will roll out its EVs that will be built on the EMA from their UK
                plant, and thereafter, Tata Motors will have the EMA platform shipped to India and will also have some
                changes made to it in order to localize it, and thereafter, start the manufacturing of Avinya in-hous

                    Uttarakhand tunnel collapse Live updates: After more than a week's endeavour to reach the 41 workers
                    trapped in a collapsed tunnel in Uttarakhand, the rescue and relief operation has entered its last
                    stage
                    after rescuers managed to place broad pipes up to a depth of 45 metres through the debris via
                    horizontal
                    drilling. Further drilling is underway.

                    Digging to rescue 41 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel is in the final stretch(ANI)
                    On Wednesday night, a senior official expressed his confidence that rescuers would reach workers and
                    complete the operation today.
                    <br>
                    The team found steel rods embedded in the debris which caused some hindrance in the drilling
                    process,
                    however, the officials said they managed to remove all the pieces of steel and carry out the final
                    process to insert the last bit of pipeline through the rubble.
                    <br>
                    Earlier on Wednesday, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel entered the tunnel, an
                    official statement issued by Uttarakhand Chief Minister's Office said.
                    <br>
                    An ambulance is also deployed inside the tunnel and a team of doctors is also put on stand-by for
                    health
                    check-ups of the workers, it said.
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will undertake a safety audit of all 29
                    under-construction tunnels across the country to ensure safety and adherence to the highest quality
                    standards, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said on Wednesday.

                        Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson informed that the truce deal would include a comprehensive
                        ceasefire in both the north and south of the Gaza Strip.
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden">
                        After seven weeks of bombardments resulting in loss of lives and property, Israel and
                        Palestinian
                        militant group Hamas have agreed to a four-day truce beginning Friday with the first batch of
                        Israeli hostages released later, Qatar said on Thursday.
                        <br>
                        What are the details of the deal?
                        Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari while addressing the reporters in Doha,
                        informed that the truce deal would include a comprehensive ceasefire in both the north and south
                        of
                        the Gaza Strip.

                        The first ceasefire in the war triggered by the Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7,
                        would
                        be accompanied by the release of 50 women and children hostages captured by the Hamas
                        terrorists,
                        while around 150 Palestinian detainees would also be released from Israeli jails as part of the
                        deal.
                        <br>
                        The first group of hostages to be released on Friday would be 13 women and children, Ansari
                        further
                        informed. "If there were a group of hostages from the same family they will be released together
                        in
                        this first batch," he added.<br>
                        "During these four days, information will be collected about the rest of the hostages to
                        consider
                        the possibility of more releases and thus extending the pause," Ansari added.
                        <br>
                        However, Israel has said that the peace deal could go beyond four days if Hamas would set free
                        at
                        least 10 hostages per day. The Qatar spokesperson also said that it hoped to negotiate a
                        subsequent
                        agreement to release additional hostages from Gaza by the fourth day of the truce. Israeli PM
                        Benjamin Netanyahu also made it clear that the country was not ending its war on Gaza and that
                        the
                        stopping of fighting was only temporary.
                        <br>
                        Commenting on the pause, Ansari said that it entailed "a complete ceasefire... with no attacks
                        from
                        the air or the ground," adding that he hoped "there will be no violations".
