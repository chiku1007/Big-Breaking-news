            <h2>Is OpenAI's latest development, the Q* model, an existential risk to humanity?</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/24/550x309/GERMANY-US-INTERNET-AI-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-3_1700816161121_1700816186341.jpg"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                Safety concerns over OpenAI's unprecedented Q* model threatens advancement in AI.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                A recent report by Reuters revealed that some researchers at OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT
                system, had raised concerns about a powerful artificial intelligence model that they were developing.
                The model, called Q*, was able to solve basic maths problems that it had not encountered before, which
                could be a significant advancement in AI. <br><br>According to the tech news site the Information, the
                Q* model, pronounced as “Q-Star”, had alarmed some safety researchers at OpenAI, who wrote to the board
                of directors before the dismissal of Sam Altman, the former chief executive of the company. They warned
                that the model could pose a threat to humanity if it was not handled carefully. <br><br>
                The report came amid a turbulent week for OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit venture with a
                mission to create “safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity”.
                <br><br>
                The board of directors fired Altman last Friday, but then reinstated him on Tuesday night after nearly
                all the company’s 750 staff threatened to resign if he was not brought back. Altman also had the support
                of Microsoft, the biggest investor in OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, which is legally bound to pursue
                the nonprofit’s mission

            <h2>What is project 'Q*’ that led to Sam Altman's OpenAI ouster before return as CEO?</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/24/550x309/ChatGPT-Altman-0_1700510901869_1700807136539.jpg"
                alt="Image">
            <p>
                Altman was reinstated within five days of his November 17 sacking, and the board that fired him was
                ‘replaced’.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                One of the reasons behind Sam Altman's sacking as OpenAI CEO – he has since returned to the company – by
                the ChatGPT creator's board, could be a project known as 'Q*,' Reuters has reported. <br><br>It must be
                noted that Altman, who was terminated on November 17, was reinstated five days later after employees
                threatened to resign en masse; the board that sacked him has also been ‘replaced.’ <br><br>
                What is project Q*?<br><br>
                According to Reuters, many people at OpenAI believe Q* (Q-Star) to be the San Francisco-based startup's
                breakthrough in its search for what is known as ‘artificial general intelligence’ (AGI). OpenAI
                describes AGI as ‘autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.’
                <br><br>
                Mira Murati, the AI research firm's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), had acknowledged the existence of Q*
                in an internal email to employees, and alerted them to ‘certain media stories’ without commenting on
                their accuracy.

            <h2>Did Rockstar just reveal the trailer release date for GTA 6?</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/23/550x309/gta-6-2560x1440-jason-vice-city-fan-art-4k-24943_1695200540731_1700755081363.jpeg"

            <p>
                Italian announcement hints at GTA 6 trailer release in early December. Can you guess the date?
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Rockstar Games has finally confirmed that the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) will be
                released in December, after a decade of waiting by the fans. <br><br>The announcement, made on November
                8, became the most popular gaming tweet ever, with more than 1.5 million likes and 178 million views. It
                also dominated the top four spots for the most-liked gaming tweets. This shows how much the Grand Theft
                Auto series has influenced the gaming culture and how loyal its fan base is. <br><br>However, the
                announcement did not specify the exact date of the trailer release, leaving many fans wondering when
                they will get to see the first glimpse of GTA 6. Some fans have tried to find clues in Rockstar’s
                announcements, especially in the Italian version.
                <br><br>
                A user named MaxLogan on GTAForums noticed that the Italian announcement used the phrase “primi giorni
                di Dicembre,” which means “first days of December.” He explained that in Italy, this usually refers to a
                period between December 3 and December 5 at the latest. He suggested that the trailer might come out
                during the first weekend of December or by Tuesday.

            <h2> Your iPhone having WiFi speed issues after iOS 17? Apple's update is on the way</h2>
            <img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/11/23/550x309/AMAZON-STOCKS--0_1691167595940_1700733054884.JPG"

            <p>
                Apple to release iOS update to fix WiFi speed issues post iOS 17 updates.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                Apple is looking to bring an iOS update to resolve WiFi speed problems reported by Manu users post iOS 17 updates. However, the date of roll out is yet to be confirmed. <br><br>The iPhone maker introduced iOS 17 in September. Notably, a significant number reported WiFi speed problems post-update, a concern absent before. Despite the 17.1.1 update, the issue persists, leading Apple to internally test iOS 17.1.2, MacRumors reported. <br><br>Details on iOS 17.1.2 are limited, but it's expected next week. Experts suggest iOS 17.2 will not only resolve reported issues but also introduce new features.
<br><br>
                What are notable introductions in Apple iOS 17.1?<br><br>
                Users can now star any song, album, playlist, or artist, saving selections to the library.
                <br><br>
                Introduces "Out of Range" option for AirDrop, enabling file exchange over Wi-Fi or cellular data even when devices are not in close proximity.
                <br><br>
                iPhones with an always-on display (iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max) can now function as smart displays in landscape mode while charging.

            <h2>Google Meet gets ability to detect raised hands. What does it do, how to use?</h2>

                The feature eliminates the need to click the hand-raise icon, that notifies participants that a person wants to talk.

            </p>
            <p class="hidden">
                For its video communication service Meet, Google has introduced an ability that will detect a person's hand if they raise it while participating in a meeting on the platform, to indicate they want to speak. <br><br>The feature eliminates the need to click the hand-raise icon, that notifies others that a participant wants to talk. <br><br>The gesture detection feature, announced by Google through a blog post on November 21, has been fully rolled out for Rapid Release domains, while for Scheduled Release domains, a gradual rollout will begin on November 28.
<br><br>
                Here is all you need to know about the feature: <br><br>
                (1.) Users must simply raise their hand; the gesture detection tool will recognise it.
                <br><br>
                (2.) You must, however, keep your hand raised for a few seconds and make sure that it is positioned right in front of the camera, away from your face and body.
                <br><br>
                (3.) Other participants will be automatically notified that you want to speak.
                <br><br>
                (4.) It must also be noted that if one is addressing the meeting, the feature will not get triggered as the person is already speaking; the ability, therefore, is activated only for a participant who is not an active speaker or someone who is not speaking at that point.
